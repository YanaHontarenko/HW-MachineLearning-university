Homework from the course of machine learning in the university. We used [lecture from habr](https://habr.com/ru/company/ods/blog/322626).
===============================================
###### HW №1
For training, it is proposed to analyze data using Pandas. Data used in competition [Ml Boot Camp 5](http://mlbootcamp.ru/round/12/sandbox/).
###### HW №2
The task is proposed using visual analysis to answer a few questions on the data on cardiovascular diseases. Data used in competition [ML Boot Camp 5](http://mlbootcamp.ru/round/12/sandbox/)
###### HW №3
In this task, you need to understand how the decision tree works in the regression problem, and also build (and configure) classifying decision trees in the problem of predicting cardiovascular diseases. Data used in competition [ML Boot Camp 5](http://mlbootcamp.ru/round/12/sandbox/)
###### HW №4
In this task, using examples, you can see how linear models are being retrained, you need to figure out why this is happening, and figure out how to diagnose and monitor retraining. Data used on Coursera open course of machine learning and data analysis course.
###### HW №5
